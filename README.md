## FIFA 23 Player Stats - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction
I chose this dataset because I **love playing and watching football** and also enjoy **playing online games**. This project combines both of my interests—**football analytics and gaming statistics**—to explore player attributes, market values, and trends in FIFA 23.

This analysis provides insights into:
- How player attributes correlate with their market value.
- The impact of work rate, nationality, and club reputation on player ratings.
- Trends in football player stats that influence in-game decisions.

By applying **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques, we uncover hidden patterns in player performance, helping both gamers and football fans understand FIFA 23 data better.

- **Contains:** Player attributes like **Overall, Potential, Wage, Work Rate, Preferred Foot, and Nationality.**
- **Objective:** Identify patterns in player attributes and understand their impact on performance.

## Key Analyses
### **Univariate Analysis**
